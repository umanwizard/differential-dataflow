//! Traits and datastructures representing a collection trace.
//!
//! A collection trace is a set of updates of the form `(key, val, time, diff)`, which determine the contents
//! of a collection at given times by accumulating updates whose time field is less or equal to the target field.
//!
//! The `Trace` trait describes those types and methods that a data structure must implement to be viewed as a
//! collection trace. This trait allows operator implementations to be generic with respect to the type of trace,
//! and allows various data structures to be interpretable as multiple different types of trace.

// 	The traces and batch and cursors want the flexibility to appear as if they manage certain types of keys and
// 	values and such, while perhaps using other representations, I'm thinking mostly of wrappers around the keys
// 	and vals that change the `Ord` implementation, or stash hash codes, or the like.
//
// 	This complicates what requirements we make so that the trace is still usable by someone who knows only about
// 	the base key and value types. For example, the complex types should likely dereference to the simpler types,
//	so that the user can make sense of the result as if they were given references to the simpler types. At the
//  same time, the collection should be formable from base types (perhaps we need an `Into` or `From` constraint)
//  and we should, somehow, be able to take a reference to the simple types to compare against the more complex
//  types. This second one is also like an `Into` or `From` constraint, except that we start with a reference and
//  really don't need anything more complex than a reference, but we can't form an owned copy of the complex type
//  without cloning it.
//
//  We could just start by cloning things. Worry about wrapping references later on.
